This is the output of my study for the course SP501, Data Visualization Fundamentals, which is part of the Data Science curriculum under **Project SPARTA**.

Before proceeding on assessing my work, please note on the following as this will be your guide in understanding the format I have in this project and some technicalities that need to be considered when working on this file.

This workbook contains 8 sheets (including READ ME! tab).
1. Raw Data is where all the survey responses are located. I manipulated it to get the visuals that I need for this project.
2. Progressive Capstone has all the essay answers to the weekly progressive capstone activities in the course.
3. Charts Backbone is the sheet where all my helper cells for the charts are found.
4. Week 1 to 4 worksheets have all the data visuals for this capstone project.
  * 4.1 week1	Overview of Data Visualization[1]
  * 4.2 week2	Charts and Graphs by Type of Story (Composition and Comparison)
  * 4.3 week3	Charts and Graphs by Type of Story (Distribution and Relationship)
  * 4.4 week4	Chart Design Principles and Data Visualization Ethics
  * 4.5 week5	Final Data Visualization
5. I used Excel for Office 365. In the final output, in sheet week5, I used some features which may not be available to older
    versions, particularly, histograms (available only as an add-in), and map chart. Should you have any problems viewing my
    final output, go to my GitHub repository[2].

    [1]Defined visualizations from SP201. My study that time was about time and money spent on travelling from home to school or work. 
    I had to run a different survey since this study wouldn't be that beneficial to the audience since the pandemic has caused several
    lockdowns/quarantines that forced people to stay at home. This time, my survey was about the satisfaction of residents of NCR on the
    what the government in national, local, and barangay levels has done to control the spread of COVID-19, the support that it has given to
    its citizens, and with how safe they feel living the new normal with all policies and protocols imposed.
